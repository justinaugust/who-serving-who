*Capstone, Part 1: Topic Proposals*

In Part 1, get started by choosing three potential topics and problems, describing your goals & criteria for success, potential audience(s), and identifying 1-2 potential datasets. In the field of data science, good projects are practical. Your capstone project should be manageable and affect a real world audience. This might be a domain you are familiar with, a particular interest you have, something that affects a community you are involved in, or an area that relates to a field you wish to work in.

One of the best ways to test ideas quickly is to share them with others. A good data scientist has to be comfortable discussing ideas and presenting to audiences. That's why for Part 1 of your Capstone project, you'll be preparing a lightning talk in addition to your initial notebook outlining the scope of your project. You will present your candidate topics in a slide deck, and should be prepared to answer questions and defend your data selection(s). Presentations should take no more than 3-5 minutes.

The ultimate choice of topic for your capstone project is yours! However, this is research and development work. Sometimes projects that look easy can be difficult and vice versa. It never hurts to have a second (or third) option available.

Goal: Prepare a 3-5 minute lightning talk that covers three potential topics, including potential sources of data, goals, metrics and audience.
Due: Wednesday, October 23

|Project Name|Goal / Outcome|Audience|Metrics|Data Source|Pros|Cons|Reasonable|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|School Success Map / Who's Serving Who?|Create a model that can predict a child's probability of achieving different success metrics at each school. Based on widely aggregated data such as socioeconomic indicators, learning differences, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, etc. Turn this into a web app where you can enter this information in - or exclude some - to find out the probability of schools serving your child well based on an outcome of your choosing.|Parents, Students|GPA, College Acceptance, Reading levels, Math Levels, High Stakes Tests, SAT/ACT Scores, High School graduation rates|State school information, ??|Content Knowledge, usable, important|Lots of data, perhaps too mission critical for some?|Initial Component|
|Representation in Data|Meta-analysis of commonly used datasets to determine if they are representative of the populations they seek to be applied to. Depending on the intended use metrics may change. |Potential users of the datasets. Dataset creators.|Depending on the dataset and intended usage metrics could be age/gender/race/location/ability/etc |Commonly available and commonly used data sources |Useful in the world - hot topic in some corners of data science. |Potentially incapable of creating it. |Could probably evaluate 1 or 2 datasets - not sure about generalizability. |
|Small Group Instruction Creation |Automate the creation of small groups for targeting instruction for teachers using Common Core Standards and formative assessments. | | | | | | |
|Mapping School Closures in Urban Areas to identify externalities as experienced by affected families|
