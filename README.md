## Initial Proposal
|Project Name|Goal / Outcome|Audience|Metrics|Data Source|Pros|Cons|Reasonable|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|School Success Map / Who's Serving Who?|Create a model that can predict a child's probability of achieving different success metrics at each school. Based on widely aggregated data such as socioeconomic indicators, learning differences, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, etc. Turn this into a web app where you can enter this information in - or exclude some - to find out the probability of schools serving your child well based on an outcome of your choosing.|Parents, Students|GPA, College Acceptance, Reading levels, Math Levels, High Stakes Tests, SAT/ACT Scores, High School graduation rates|State school information, ??|Content Knowledge, usable, important|Lots of data, perhaps too mission critical for some?|Initial Component|
